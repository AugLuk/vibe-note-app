# 📒 vibe-note-app

**A simple personal note-taking app built as a demonstration of agentic AI coding.**

---

## 🌟 Project Purpose

**vibe-note-app** is a minimalist web application designed to let you quickly create, edit, and delete personal notes—no accounts, no frills. But its real vibe is *how it was built*: this project serves as a hands-on experiment in agentic AI-driven coding.

Instead of writing the code manually, the app was developed using [Roo Code]'s Orchestrator Mode—an advanced agentic AI system that splits up complex coding tasks and delegates them to specialized agents. This approach explores what's possible when an AI architect manages software development at a high level.

*In short: It's a basic note app, and a cool tech test for how far AI agents can go in automating real app development!*

## 🤖 Project Development Process

The entire development process was orchestrated by Roo Code's "Orchestrator Mode" (a.k.a. Boomerang Mode):

- **High-level goal provided:**  
  A prompt (see below) described the requirements for the app—core features, tech stack, directory layout, and constraints.
- **AI task decomposition:**  
  The Orchestrator agent broke down the project into subtasks (backend API, frontend UI, data models, integration, etc.), routing each piece to specialized sub-agents (like Code or Debug agents) for execution.
- **Integration:**  
  The Orchestrator agent coordinated the sub-agents, assembling the outputs into a working Rails 8 backend and a Next.js (TypeScript) frontend, all as specified.
- **Agent-only code:**  
  All code and configuration was generated by AI, with minimal guidance (only supplying the prompt, and asking to use different ports).

This project demonstrates end-to-end development via agentic AI, highlighting how tasks can be partitioned, reasoned about, and executed autonomously.

## 🏗️ Technical Details

### **Architecture**

- **Backend:**  
  [Ruby on Rails 8](https://rubyonrails.org/) API server
  - Data stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
  - No authentication or user accounts (single-user app).
  - Listens on port `3003`.

- **Frontend:**  
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
  - Interacts with the Rails API for all note data.
  - Runs on port `3004`.

- **Project Structure:**  
  - `backend/` — Rails API  
  - `frontend/` — Next.js client

### **Core Features**

- Create, edit, and delete notes (plaintext).
- View a list of all existing notes.
- No encryption, security, login, or multi-user support.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

**Requirements (already installed):**

- Rails 8
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- NPM

**Clone the repository, then:**

1. **Setup the backend (Rails 8 API):**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    bundle install               # Install Ruby dependencies
    rails db:setup               # Create and seed the PostgreSQL DB
    rails s                      # Start the Rails server (default: port 3003)
    ```

2. **Setup the frontend (Next.js + TypeScript):**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install                  # Install JS dependencies
    npm run dev                  # Start the app (default: port 3004)
    ```

3. **Usage:**
    - Access the app at [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)
    - Add, edit, and delete notes.
    - Backend API listens at [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

## 💡 Project Prompt (For the Curious)

> Develop a basic note-taking application with the following requirements:
> 
> - Core Features: Enable note creation, editing, and deletion.
> - User Management: Support a single user only; no authentication or account management is necessary.
> - Backend: Implement a Rails 8 server with a PostgreSQL database.
> - Frontend: Use Next.js with TypeScript for the client interface.
> - Project Structure: The backend should be created in a new `backend/` directory, and the frontend in `frontend/`.
> - Data Transfer: Notes can be exchanged as plaintext; no data encryption or secure transmission is required.
> - Testing: No Rails specs or client-side tests are needed.
> - Environment: Rails 8, PostgreSQL, Node, and NPM are already installed. Install any additional dependencies as needed.
> - Scope: Limit implementation strictly to note management; do not add any extra features or functionality.
> 
> Deliver a complete Rails 8 backend and a Next.js + TypeScript frontend, ensuring they interact as specified.
